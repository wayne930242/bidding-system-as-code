              |Upgrade often.\
              |2-bid openers will often bid again where a std. weak two bidder could not,
              |e.g. after being raised or with extra length,
              |or with a takeout double if short in the opponents' suit.\
              |2/1 GF (2C 3-way), unless opener has 5-4+ majors.\
              |Third/Fourth Seat - 2-bids are (6)8-12 (mb 5332 or 5-4 majors) with nat responses,
              |1-bids 13+, 2/1 not GF, 4-level pree vul-appropriate
              |
              |X/XX by wide-range hand (that has already bid previously)
              |shows cards while bids all show minimums, even jumps.\
              |X by 0-9 hand later is takeout.\
              |Most all other doubles are takeout.""".trimMargin()
